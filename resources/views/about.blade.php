                This service has been developed in order to download PKPasses which are not downloaded directly to your
                iPhone.<br/>
                Unfortunately some companies forget to send the <code>.pkpass</code> directly to the email, and
                force you to download it on your desktop, if you're not ordering from Mobile.
            </p>

                This app was developed using <code>Laravel</code> and <code>TailwindCSS</code>.<br/>
